Using AccuWeather API to create a weather app

This was an exercise to pull the information from Weather API ( Accuweather in this case)  and to pull out the information that we need to make us of. 
The api key included will only alllow 50 requests, as is a temporary key. 

To run up again will need to get a new api key from the https://developer.accuweather.com/user/me/apps in order to hit the API.
